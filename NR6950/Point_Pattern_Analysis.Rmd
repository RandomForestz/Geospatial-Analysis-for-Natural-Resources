## Point-Pattern Analysis (PPA) - Definition 

Point-Pattern Analysis is the is the examination of the spatial arrangements of points in (usually 2-dimensional) space. While, PPA allows us to examine patterns, it is what the points represent that allows us to better understand the world around us. 

PPA is a big topic in spatial statistics. So for time's sake (We have much to cover yet!), we won't be covering anything too crazy. We will be learning how to set up a point pattern analysis study with our data, visualize point density, and use a simple function to estimate relationships and randomness. 

## Kernal Density

Kernel density is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable.

## SpatStat

Spatstat is a family of packages for the statistical analysis of spatial point patterns.
Load the Spatstat package. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# point pattern analysis with spatstat

library(terra)
library(spatstat)
prj.aeaN83 <- "+proj=aea +lat_1=29.5 +lat_2=45.5 +lat_0=23 +lon_0=-96 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs"  

```

## Data

For this analysis, we are going to be analyzing point patterns for various causes of fires in Tonto National Forest located in central Arizona. 

In your week 9 data folder, you should find two shapefiles:

- fire_tonto.shp (Fire occurrence starting points)

- Tonto_NF.shp (Tonto National Forest Boundary)

![](D:/R Textbook Template/NR6950 Notebook/NR 6950 Notebook/images/tonto.jpg)

```{r}
fire <- terra::vect("D:/R Textbook Template/NR6950 Notebook/NR 6950 Notebook/Data/Point_pattern/fire_tonto.shp")
tonto <- terra::vect("D:/R Textbook Template/NR6950 Notebook/NR 6950 Notebook/Data/Point_pattern/Tonto_NF.shp")

fire <- terra::project(fire, prj.aeaN83)
tonto <- terra::project(tonto, prj.aeaN83)

```


```{r}
head(fire,5)
```


### Initial Plotting

The fire points shapefile contains a column called "STATISTICA", which contains the different classes of fire starts.

Let's go ahead and give our data some initial plotting. 

```{r}

terra::plot(fire, "STATISTICA", plg=list(x="bottomleft", title = "Ignition Cause"), 
            pax=list(las=1), main = "Fire Starts")
terra::plot(tonto, add = T)


```

## Point Pattern Analysis - Code

### Observation Window - as.owin()

as.owin() is the function for creating an "observation window" for point pattern analysis. Basically it creates the bounding box for which inside our analysis will take place. 

```{r}
terra::plot(tonto)
```


In our case, we want to look at point pattern analysis within Tonto National Forest. We will turn that polygon into our "owin".

---

```{r}
library(spatstat)
tontoOwin <- as.owin(sf::st_as_sf(tonto))
class(tontoOwin)
```

NOTE: We brought in our shapefiles as spatvectors through the terra library. We must have our shapefile be an sf object to become an "owin". Use st_as_sf() to change our spatvector to sf.

---


### ppp()

The function ppp() works on changing the coordinates of a dataset of points (our fire starts) into the class "ppp". "ppp" represents a point pattern dataset in the two-dimensional plane.

---

To create a "ppp" you must create a dataset that has only coordinates. We can do this by using crds() from the terra package.

```{r}
pts <- terra::crds(fire)
head(pts)
```

---

Now that we have our coordinates, we can develop our ppp by using the function and following syntax:

---

**variable <- ppp(point_dataset[,1], point_dataset[,2], window = tontoOwin)**

---

[,1] & [,2] refer to each column within our dataset (longitude and latitude) and the window refers to the observation window we created of the Tonto National Forest polygon.

```{r}
p <- ppp(pts[,1], pts[,2], window=tontoOwin) # define x and y point and window

p # what does this look like?

plot(p) # plots the ppp (points) and the window (boundary) together.

```

---

### density()

density(), from the *stats* package (don't worry, it's already loaded for you in R by default), computed the kernel density estimates from a point pattern dataset (our "ppp"). 
Simply put in our "ppp" which is assigned to p.

```{r}
ds <- density(p)

```

---

If we check the class of "ds" we will see it is "im". 

```{r}
class(ds)
```

"im" represents a two-dimensional pixel image.

--

## Plotting Point Density

And as simple as that, we can plot the kernel density estimates for our point pattern of fire starts!

```{r}
plot(ds, main='fire start density')
```

---

### Plotting Multiple

Below is some code for a for-loop that sets up a quick plot of 4 specific fire start causes. We will generate point density and test whether two of these have spatial relationships.

For this example, We will examine fires caused by:

- Equipment Use

- Smoking

- Campfires

- Arson


```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
for (type in c("2 -  Equipment Use", "3 -  Smoking", "4 -  Campfire", "7 -  Arson")) {
  plot(tonto, col='grey')
  fire_t <- fire[fire$STATISTICA == type, ]
  points(fire_t, col = "red")
  title(type)
}

```

## Multiple Point Patterns

We can do the same process as above for all of the objects in the dataset at once by using **marks =** withon our ppp() function. 

The categories for fire starts are within the fire point dataset under the column *STATISTICA*. Since these categories are text and not factors, the ppp() function wont understand that they are really different categories of fire starts. 

We can produce a ppp class that has each category readily available to plot as a density.

In our code below, lets make the fire categories a factor and then assign them to our marks =. 

```{r}

# add in marks by using as.factor() around the column of interest.
mpp <- ppp(pts[,1], pts[,2], window = tontoOwin, marks=as.factor(fire$STATISTICA))


```

### Plot Multiple Point Patterns 

Now lets plot the 4 point patterns of interest.

```{r}
spp <- split(mpp) # divides data into groups based upon marks = above

plot(density(spp[c(2:4, 7)]), main='') # Plot Densities

```

## K Cross Function

Now that we have generated point patterns for our fire starts, we can do a quick test to see if they is any clustering of two sets of patterns or to infer there is any relationship to their occurrences. 

Using the envelope() function, we will examine clustering between smoking are arson point patterns. The syntax is as follows:

**variable <- envelope(ppp variable, Kcross, nsim = # of choice, i = "variable 1", j = "variable 2")

---

NOTE:

- nsim = Number of simulated point patterns to be generated when computing the envelopes

---

Let's plot: 

```{r}
ekc <- envelope(mpp, Kcross, nsim = 5, i = "3 -  Smoking", j = "7 -  Arson")
plot(ekc, main = "Smoking and Arson")

```

### Interpretation

The dashed red line in our KCross plot represents the reference line for complete spatial randomness between the two point patterns.

---

The grey line around the red line is the randomization envelope.

---

The black line represent the Kcross function for these two point patterns.

---

So our black line is quite a bit higher than the red dashed line. This gives us evidence that there is clustering of the two point patterns in this example.
